# DATA Scripts
Recovery and/or processing of astrophotography data.

## Stacking the three RGB wavelengths of DSCOVR photos

**The script asks you to enter a colour palette and then displays the 10 wavelengths using this palette. If you close the window containing the 10 wavelengths, the final RGB photo is displayed.**

- Use the ‘DSCOVR_RGB_Stacking.py’ script
- You need to install Python and the h5py, numpy, matplotlib and tkinter libraries
- On line 26, enter the name of the h5 file you want to use
- Put the Python script in the same folder as the h5 file and run it from there

## Creating a timelapse with photos from the GOES-18 or GOES-19 satellite

- Download the Timelapse-GOES.ps1 script and place it in the folder of your choice.
- Right-click on the file and click on “Run with PowerShell.”
- The script will guide you step by step through its use.
